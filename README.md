Case Study: Establishing relationship between different parameters from pedestrian data for NYC

Here we are trying to pick a dataset and do some in depth researcha round regression.

We cover the following things:

1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Best fit models
5. Forward and backward models
6. Criteria Plots
7. Matrix Methods for regression
8. Logistic Regression

-- This was part of a final project in Advance Regression class during my time as a Masters student in Statistics.

Dataset:
It was taken from New York open source library. We are trying to analyze the pedestrians data here on a regular day in the city trying to come from or going towards Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.
